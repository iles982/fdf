# FDF

FDF

A simple 3D height-map renderer. You can rotate models, color is defined by relative height in the map. More features planned!

Compiling and running
Run make. An executable will compile. Currently only tested on MacOS.

Run it with ./fdf [map]. A bunch of sample maps are provided in the maps directory.
